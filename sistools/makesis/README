Makesis 4

This is a tool for generating sis files, conforming to the new sis file format
used in Symbian 9. (The specification of this format is available in
http://developer.symbian.com/main/downloads/papers/SymbianOSv91/softwareinstallsis.pdf).

It is based on the original modified makesis 2.0.0 release; the parser and the
rest of the front end of the tool is modified to handle the new pkg file format,
the SIS file generation back end is completely replaced with new code.

The parts descending from the original makesis release from Symbian is licensed
according to the Symbian Example Source License (see License.txt), the new
parts written from scratch are licensed according to the LGPL (see COPYING).

This version of makesis can sign the sis directly using a built-in selfsigned
certificate, using the switch -c. This should only be used under development,
you should preferrably sign the sis for distribution with a certificate of
your own.

This also includes a signsis replacement, and a small makekeys tool which
acts as a wrapper for the openssl commandline tool for generating keys
and certificates.
